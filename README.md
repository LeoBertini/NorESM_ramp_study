DESCRIPTION OF POST-PROCESSED DATA

##############Statistical Results##############
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o62Zr4Tw-npM6_kNsQUzc2U5cDyGH1_T?usp=sharing

Contains percentage change and the statistical comparisson  results between Pre-Industrial and: 
1) years 250-280; 
2) years 350-380 and 
3) years 350-380

Files are for each variable : pH, AOU, o2sat (oxygen saturation), o2 (dissolved oxygen), omegac( Calcite Saturation State), templvl (temperature), epc100 (POCexport)


##############Time scale analyses ##############
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M0vbH0hiiDIqOshxMqmSYp9oZ_Sb1Sd9?usp=sharing

Contains Time scale estimates for Time of Departure (ToD), Time of Recovery (Trec) and extent of change (Maxchange) 
for different prescribed envelopes of 1 standard deviation, 2 standard diviations and 3 standard deviations. 

Obs. Trec estimates are based on a linear regression using the last 100 years of the time series whenever there is no recovery whitin the time span of the simulation.
